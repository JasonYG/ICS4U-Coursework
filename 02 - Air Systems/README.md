Air Systems Reflection
---
The Air Systems assignment is a project that is used to develop skills in project management. The task occured during the week of February 25, to March 1, 2019.

In Air Systems, teams of 4 to 5 people are responsible for developing prototype models for a company. Each team is handed a copy of a fictitious company's proposal which outlines the task that is to be completed.

When I first looked over the proposal, I was intimidated by the professional jargon and formality of the language. The proposal looked _real_; not some assignment rubric. After closer inspection though, the proposal was easy enough to understand. There were only key points to be understood - prototype specifications, material costs, roles, etc. We also had to choose roles.

## Project Manager
The Project Manager (PM) was the 'leader' of the team. They were responsible for creating detailed plans, budgeting, and for tracking the team's progress. During the first two days, the PM had to create a project proposal, budget, and detailed schedules.

This was the role I ended up undertaking.

## Project Office
The Project Office (PO) was similar to the PM, in that they were responsible for the logistical aspects of the project. Since my group was only 4 people, I ended up taking on this role as well as PM.

## Quality Assurance
The Quality Assurance (QA) was responsible for developing a set of guidelines to determine whether or not our prototype was successful. The criteria was specific, detailed, and strictly adhered to.

## Project Design Manager
The Project Design Manager (PDM) was responsible for creating the design for the prototype. They were most busy on Day 2.

## Project Development Engineer
The Project Development Engineer (PDE) was responsible for creating the prototypes using the designs from the PDM.

Thought and Comments

Overall, the project was a great learning experience. In my opinion, the Project Management aspect of the ICS 4U course will be one of, if not the most pertinent to a future career in computer science or software development. Even though the programming aspects are important, a lot of those skills will be relearned and rendered obsolete in post-secondary education. Project Management, on the other hand, will always be crucial in the work place in almost every software-related career.

I felt like the project was a good representation of the workplace, especially with the sudden changes that had to be adapted for. Air Systems stressed the importance of flexibility in real life: there will often be circumstances that are out of your control. 

As PM, I was initailly overwhelmed with the numerous documents I had to create, but by the second day, it became much more manageable. In general, I felt like I did a good job of remaining flexible and planning for contingency; however, I should have been more involved in the group dynamic. Although everyone had defined roles, I don't think I communicated very well with everyone on the team. I was too scared of stepping past the scope of my job, and as a result, I didn't give my input on certain design features. In the next few projects, I'd like to be less scared of strictly adhering to my role, and instead offer my opinions to the group.
